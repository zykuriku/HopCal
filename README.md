# HopCal

A Flutter project for Hopkinson's test on identical dc machines.

Concept: After entering 4 current values, the app will generate several values like Armature copper loss, Stray loss per machine, Field loss, Input and Output power, Efficiency, etc for DC motor as well as generator in the form of a table. A user can then get a plotted graph of efficiency vs power based on the table values.

Language used: Dart

State management used: GetX

Some instances from the app (based on random values):
